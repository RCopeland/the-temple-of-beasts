# The Ring of the Cloven Hoof 

The ring has 3 charges and it regains 1d3 spent charges at dawn.

Using a charge allows the wearer to cast the spell polymorph, except instead of a chosen creature, the caster 
must roll 1d10 on the random creature table below, and transform into the listed creature. 

## Polymorph (altered)
- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 60 feet
- Target: A creature that you can see within range
- Duration: Up to 1 hour

This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a 
Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.

The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. 
It retains its alignment and personality. The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its 
normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result 
of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t 
reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, 
or take any other action that requires hands or speech. The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t 
activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
