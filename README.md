# The Temple of Beasts

I wrote this as a first attempt at writing an standalone adventure for my D&D group.
I haven't been able to run it yet, but will update when I do.

I built it with Gatsby and did the layout with CSS Grid.

## Adventure

- intended for a group of four, level 3 characters

## Overview
This adventure is about a temple, built to house a relic of chaos. The temple 
was built long ago and forgotten, sealed and concealed deep in the forest. The relic has a 
mate, the relic of law. Recently discovered by a group of knights, the relic of law guides them
to seek out and destroy the relic of chaos. Simultaneously, in a nearby village, several villagers 
have gone missing. They disappear from their beds or while traveling. Are the disappearances
related to the relics and the temple?

## Background (DM)
The relic of chaos is actually one of a pair of magical items. They were created to be mates and call to each other.
In ages past, the relics were separated and sealed within hidden temples, a good distance apart. The knights discover 
the relic of law while excavating a temple in the pursuit of holy relics. The law relic guides them to break from their
regiment and to seek out the chaos relic. Currently, the knights have discovered the chaos temple and have set up a camp
within it. They are currently in a stalemate with the other occupants of the temple, the beasts.
The chaos relic has also been recently uncovered. Stirred by the discovery of the law relic, the chaos relic draws to it 
a traveller. The traveller is an interplanetary creature, seeking to study the unique lifeforms of the planets it encounters. 
A shapechanger by nature, the traveller finds the chaos relic and begins to use it to transform locals into all manner of beasts.
He then engages the beasts in battle with each other in order to collect information for his logs.

If the relics are reunited, the creator is summoned, collects them both, and disappears.
