# List

- Eagle x 3
- Blood Hawk x 3
- Giant Bat x 2
- Griffon x 2

# Tactics
The creatures will fight to the death, unless they think they're able
to escape with a corpse (friend or foe).

The eagles will fly down and attack, then fly back up.
If an eagle triggers an AoO from a PC, the griffons or bat will
also fly down and attack that foe.

Otherwise, the creatures will always attack the weakest looking target.
