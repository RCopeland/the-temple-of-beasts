# List 

- Octopus x 3
- Giant Crab x 2
- Reef Shark x 3
- Killer Whale x 1 

# Tactics
All creatures will fight to the death, unless they're able to 
steal a corpse (friend or foe) and escape with it.

The Killer Whale and Reef Sharks will focus on the nearest enemy with their
bites. The Sharks will prefer pack tactics advantaged attacks over non, but will
always attack the closest despite this.

The Giant Crabs will try to grapple and drag PCs toward the bigger creatures, hoping to 
get them killed and make off with the body. If the PC is too strong to grapple, the crab will 
attack instead

The octopi float around helping to distract PCs, they will also use
Ink cloud when they're able and will do so to disable PCs or to flee
