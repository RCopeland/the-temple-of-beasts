# The Temple

## Background
In a long forgotten time, a primitive cult of chaos worshippers built a temple to honor their god. The used prayer and
magic to imbue a ring with the essence of their god. This cult eventually died off, entombing the ring and remaining survivors 
inside the temple. After a thousand years, led by a diviner, a group of knights found the temple, seeking the relic 
to destroy it. However, as the knights explore deeper into the structure, they are assaulted by all manner of beasts. They seem to be 
eager to kill and are also preventing any advancement into the structure. When a knight falls, strangely, the beasts fight each 
other for the corpse and take it further into the structure, even abandoning battles in progress to do so.
The temple has also been inhabited by another being. An alien being known as the traveller has taken up residence 
in the temple and is using the relic to transform people into beasts. His purpose is to collect information about 
the battle effectiveness of the planet's creatures. 

### A1. Entrance / Puzzle
  A large room with stone walls and floor, open arches allow the wind to blow in, carrying with it detritus from the 
  forest floor.
  Lying at the center of this dusty room is a stone altar. Upon the altar are several branches with berries, 
  assorted fruits and vegetables, a few gold coins. A successful DC10 Religion check reveals this to be an altar to 
  the god Silvanus, god of nature.
  A successful DC10 perception check reveals scratches on the floor that seem to indicate a door on the east wall. 
  Searching the altar reveals the mechanism that opens the door.
  Pushing it causes a stone slab that previously blended into the wall to swing out, revealing a dark passage to the east.
  After a few seconds, a rumble can be heard within the wall, and the door slowly closes, settling back into its 
  place, blending into the wall.

### A2. Treasure Alcove 
   Tracks surround an open chest in the middle of the room. The chest is covered in elaborate carvings and magic runes,
   long since spent their power.
   The chest sits on a sliding panel that opens to reveal a staircase down. 

   In order to open the sliding panel, enough weight and magical power must be placed within the chest and 
   the lid closed.

   When the party manages to solve the puzzle, a metal whirring can be heard below as the sliding panel opens. Sand
   and dirt fall into the widening hole. Cobwebs span the new opening and a dank smell of mold hits you as you stare 
   into the darkness.
   
### A3. The knights (Camped in the barracks of the temple) 
   Coming up to the door, the party sees the light of a campfire, which also illuminates two figures, humanoid, in full plate
armor. They cross their swords as you approach, blocking your path. You can also smell food cooking coming from within.
   
   This room is where the knights of the silver gauntlet make camp. If the players can make themselves believed to be
lawful or to support a just cause, they are permitted entry.

   Entering the room, you see a series of cots, most of which have an owner, either sleeping up and preparing 
   gear or weapons. Generally, the knights pay you little mind, they go about their business. 

### A4. Infirmary
   This room is filled with cots, the same as in area A3. However, the majority of these are blood soaked and occupied 
by a knight with some kind of serious injury. Some have been beaten severely, or bitten. Some have been poisoned and burned. 
You also notice in the corner of the room, there are a few statues of knights, forever locked in a state of battle.

   There is a younger knight, serving as the primary battle medic. He knows about most of the types of creatures 
that the knights have encountered so far.

### A5. Prayer room
A large stone room with make shift seats, all facing a religious icon. There are a few knights here, lost in prayer. 
There is also an older man, dressed in robes, and appears to be leading some of the men in prayer.

### A6. MAZE - random encounter table / system
Dusty stone hallways that go on forever. Occasionally they take turns or are blocked by doors.
Often, you come across corpses of birds, livestock, etc.
- rumbling starts after a while - the ship preparing to leave

### A7. Dining Hall
Huge stone room, remnants of tables and chairs, was at some long time ago a grand dining room. Now 
it is covered in battle scars and blood. Varied winged beasts circle above as a squad of knights tries in vain
to swing their swords and jab with their spears.

### A8. Armoury
This room could have been an armoury in times past, evidenced by the iron shelves and the cage. However, the room is now
half flooded and all manner of aquatic creatures are swirling in the deep water. You see three knights frantically 
stabbing into the water with their spears.

### A9. Storehouse
A gigantic room filled with shelves and smashed crates. You see gigantic beasts fighting 2 or 3 knights each. 
The roars are deafening. 

### A10. Brewery
  The room is covered in blood. There are knight corpses everywhere. This was a battlefield, but is one no longer. Its now
a menagerie of beasts all fighting with each other to claim the corpses of the knights.
There is a decorated entry to the next room, but the beasts guard it frantically. 

### A11. The Antichamber 
   Once a sacred space for devotion, this small room is now covered in glass bottles and books. Signs of experiments in 
progress. 

### A12. The Prison
   This room is lined with cages, in each are commoners and a few knights. In some others, are beasts.
   The knights know that they are being transmuted into beasts, and then are offered a chance to change back
    if they deliver a (any) corpse to the traveller. 
   
### A13. The Ship
   This room is enclosed in metal, it seems to be part of a craft that has crashed on top of a hallway in this structure.
On the walls there are display panels with blinking lights and moving dials.

### A14. The Bridge
  This room contains a giant screen that displays a field of stars. You can see lines drawn to one of the dots and labelled 
in a language you've never seen. There also appears to be a some numbers flashing and the counter is blinking red.
  On the center throne, sits an old man, who welcomes you. 

#### The traveller
Once the battle begins, the ship will take off in 4 rounds. Whether the traveller is alive or not, after 4 rounds, the 
party is teleported beneath the levitating ship and they watch it rise up, tearing through the earth and disappearing into the 
sky.

### A14. The Relic
The door to this room is elaborately decorated in ancient patterns. Next to the door way is a plate filled with offerings,
long ruined by time.
At the center of the room is a pedastal, on top of which is floating a single golden ring, mounted to which is 
a small black gem in the shape of a goat's head.

   -  ring of the cloven hoof - magic item that changes the villager into a random thing 
   - relic inspired worship in a primitive cult who built the temple. The power attracted the traveller. 

Once the relic is removed, the party must escape the temple in 10 rounds before 
it collapses, killing them.
