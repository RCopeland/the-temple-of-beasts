# Frygg Claytown

## Stat block
Guard - MM - pg 347

Frygg stands with an awkward posture, likely from long hours at guard. She values most life, fairness and 
moderation. She will be quick to anger if one of these is challenged. She is loyal to her order to a fault and
will defend the honor of the knights, violently if necessary.

She is tasked with finding adventurers to assist the knights in their goal of destroying the 
relic. She will provide them the details of the temple's location and how to gain entry (the secret door and the second
secret door).

She offers 100 gp per person as a reward, but finds negotiating distasteful.
