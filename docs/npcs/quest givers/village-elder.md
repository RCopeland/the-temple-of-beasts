# Drest Stoneport
Drest if from a nearby forest village (insert into campaign). He seeks out adventurers to
investigate the disappearance of several of his villagers. 

He offers the following details:
- random assortment of villagers who've gone missing. About 20 or so.
- the disappearances happen at night usually, but sometimes when the person has
wandered off alone.

He suggests that the 'cursed' temple in the forest has something to do with it, but that
should come off as superstitious to the party. 

He offers a meager sum of 200gp for the party to share and has no other information.
