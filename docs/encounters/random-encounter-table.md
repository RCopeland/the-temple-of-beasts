# Random Encounters
The temple is infested with packs of roaming beasts. While travelling in the
temple, entering any hallway should trigger a roll on the random encounter table.
If the PCs attempt to long rest anywhere inside the temple, their sleep is interrupted
by beasts from the table.
Short resting triggers a roll.
